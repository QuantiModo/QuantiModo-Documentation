<h1>Front-End Designer/Developer</h1>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]We're looking for a Product Designer to join the team at QuantiModo. Interested in designing a product that helps the world? Then read onâ€¦
<h3>ABOUT YOU</h3>
You're a maker. Most of what you'll do on a daily basis is designing, mocking, prototyping, testing, and iterating on the core QuantiModo product. QuantiModo has an enormous world changing mission to eradicate mental illness in the same way that polio was once eradicated. Since this challenge is so great, we need the brightest minds in the world to help us realize this goal.

You design in HTML and CSS, and you're not afraid of JS. You'll be committing your work alongside engineers in our main codebase. Photoshop-only designers need not apply.

You design for the web. Your design is modern and clean. You've built functional web-apps before and understand the ramifications of web-app trends. You spend less time in Sketch than you do in your code editor and browser. You probably spend an equal amount of time with Chrome Dev Tools open as you do closed.

You're a master at handling complexity. Behind the scenes, QuantiModo is a technical beast, but you thrive at delivering a joyful, easy-to-use experience to each customer so they can succeed at using the product. QuantiModo is probably the hardest product you'll ever work on.

Your design process might include wireframing, low-fidelity mocking, high-fidelity mocking, and plenty of user testing along the way. You don't "toss designs over the wall" rather you work closely with engineers to implement your own designs.

You can prioritize the 5 projects on your plate. There's no shortage of things you could be doing at QuantiModo. But you're a pro at prioritizing your work. You're comfortable communicating and when something is blocking you, you aren't shy about reaching out to fellow teammates to get back up and running as quickly as possible.

You love working with customers (and teammates) to help understand their needs and generate a product spec. You can help turn that spec into reality.

You love doing things efficiently. At QuantiModo, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.

You love to set your own course with our shared set of goals. At QuantiModo, you'll have a weekly project meeting, daily scrum meetings, and then you go make things happen. You default to action.
<h3>THINGS YOU MIGHT DO</h3>
QuantiModo is a startup, so you'll likely get your hands dirty in a little bit of everything. That said, here are some things you'll do:
<ul>
	<li>Design, mock, prototype, test, and iterate on QuantiModo's main user-facing product</li>
	<li>Get your hands dirty implementing your designs in HTML, CSS, and some JS</li>
	<li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of active users every day</li>
	<li>Help conduct A/B tests and other experiments</li>
	<li>Work and ship product independently</li>
	<li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts</li>
	<li>Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible</li>
	<li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change</li>
</ul>
<h3>ABOUT QUANTIMODO</h3>
For the past two years, QuantiModo has been working to usher in an era of personalized preventative medicine through crowdsourced clinical research by providing a new secure platform capable of aggregating massive amounts of heterogeneous life-tracking data. We will create a tool to help clinicians and those suffering from chronic conditions determine personalized effectiveness rates of treatments and the percent likelihood of root causes. Furthermore, we will give researchers the ability to run and publish large-scale observational research studies in a matter of minutes on stratified user groups.

We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10x the impact with less work.

We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.

We believe that credentials are not needed. What you love doing is way more important than the credentials you have.[/vc_column_text][kleo_button title="Click to Apply" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BtBvy7yTeeBIrKYuTgu4laxTlxLZbAc6eyUkGZt1KKI/viewform" style="highlight style2" size="lg" special="yes" icon="0"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
