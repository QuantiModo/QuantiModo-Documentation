### Study Abstract

<p class="ng-binding">
  These data suggest with a high degree of confidence (p=0) that Pro-Biotics Plus (Treatments) has a weakly positive predictive relationship (R=-0.657) with Inflammatory Pain (Symptoms). The highest quartile of Inflammatory Pain measurements were observed following an average 0tabletsPro-Biotics Plus. The lowest quartile of Inflammatory Pain measurements were observed following an average 0.71tabletsPro-Biotics Plus.
</p>

### Study Background

<p class="ng-binding">
  In order to reduce suffering through the advancement of human knowledge, I have chosen to share my findings regarding the relationship between Pro-Biotics Plus and Inflammatory Pain.
</p>

### Study Objective<a href="https://quantimo.do/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pro-Biotics-Plus-vs-Inflammatory-Pain-Scatterplot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-19974"><img class="size-full wp-image-19974 alignright" src="https://quantimo.do/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pro-Biotics-Plus-vs-Inflammatory-Pain-Scatterplot.png" alt="Pro-Biotics Plus vs Inflammatory Pain Scatterplot" width="293" height="294" /></a>

<p class="ng-binding">
  The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the relationship (if any) between the Pro-Biotics Plus and the Inflammatory Pain. Additionally, we attempt to determine the Pro-Biotics Plus values most likely to produce optimal Inflammatory Pain values.
</p>

### Study Design

<p class="ng-binding">
  This study design is consistent with an n=1 observational natural experiment.
</p>

### Data Analysis

<p class="ng-binding">
  Pro-Biotics Plus data below 0 tablets was assumed erroneous and removed. 0 tablets was assumed for days without Pro-Biotics Plus data. It was assumed that 0.5 hours would pass before a change in Pro-Biotics Plus would produce an observable change in Inflammatory Pain. It was assumed that Pro-Biotics Plus could produce an observable change in Inflammatory Pain for as much as 7 days after the stimulus event.
</p>

### Data Sources

<p class="ng-binding">
  The <a href="https://quantimo.do/">QuantiModo</a> platform was used to aggregate data from the <a href="https://quantimo.do/data-sources">data sources</a>.
</p> Pro-Biotics Plus data was collect using: 

[Med Helper][1]. Inflammatory Pain data was collected using:[Cardiograph][1]. 
### Significance Explanation

<p class="ng-binding">
  Using a two-tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05, it was determined that the change in Inflammatory Pain is statistically significant at 95% confidence interval.
</p>

### Study Limitations

<p class="ng-binding">
  As with any human experiment, it was impossible to control for all potentially confounding variables. The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations. Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time. 28 paired data points were used in this analysis. Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Pro-Biotics Plus values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance. Furthermore, it will be very enlightening to aggregate this data with the data from other participants with similar genetic, diseasomic, environmentomic, and demographic profiles.
</p>

### Study Results

<p class="ng-binding">
  This analysis suggests that HIGHER Pro-Biotics Plus (Treatments) generally predicts LOWER Inflammatory Pain (p = 0). Inflammatory Pain is, on average, 9% HIGHER after around 0 Pro-Biotics Plus. After an onset delay of 168 hours, Inflammatory Pain is, on average, -16% LOWER than its average over the 168 hours following around 0.71 Pro-Biotics Plus. 28 data points were used in this analysis. The value for Pro-Biotics Plus changed 12 times, effectively running 6 separate natural experiments. The top quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 0 tablets of Pro-Biotics Plus. The bottom quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 0.71 tablets of Pro-Biotics Plus. Forward Pearson Correlation Coefficient was -0.657 (p=0, 95% CI -0.746 to -0.568 onset delay = 0.5 hours, duration of action = 168 hours) . The Reverse Pearson Correlation Coefficient was -0.61 (P=0, 95% CI -0.699 to -0.521, onset delay = -0.5 hours, duration of action = -168 hours). When the Pro-Biotics Plus value is closer to 0 tablets than 0.71 tablets, the Inflammatory Pain value which follows is, on average, 9% percent higher than its typical value. When the Pro-Biotics Plus value is closer to 0.71 tablets than 0 tablets, the Inflammatory Pain value which follows is 0% lower than its typical value.
