In an effort to accelerate the rate of clinical discovery, we have initiated development of the following open source WordPress plugins. These will allow anyone to easily create their own website for collecting and visualizing data in pursuit of exploring and solving specific health problems.
<div>Additionally, we have open-sourced the QuantiModo Android apps and Chrome extensions. This amounts to a complete open source framework for data visualization, collection, and research. This will also allow anyone with a Wordpress site could easily add a quantitative research element.</div>
