<h2>My Theory of the Biochemical Action of Memantine</h2>
Your brain cells (neurons) have these little keyholes in them (called NDMA receptors).  Normally, glutamate molecules (or keys) floating around in your brain will bind to these receptors (analogous to a key unlocking a door).  The door in the neuron is called a calcium ion channel. This lets a bunch of calcium ions rush into the neuron.

Calcium flux through NMDARs is thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism for learning and memory. However, allowing high levels of calcium ions to enter the cell activates a number of enzymes that damage cell structures.  This may be the mechanism by which Alzheimer's disease damages the brain.  It is also likely the mechanism by which tolerances are built towards Adderall, wellbutrin, and other dopminergic psychostimulants.  This neurotoxic process is sometimes referred to as excitotoxicity.

The anti-alzheimer's disease drug called Memantine blocks this neurotoxic process.  Memantine molecules clog up the keyholes (NDMA receptors) so the glutamate molecules can't get in there to open the calcium ion channel (the door).  This prevents the neuronal damage and resulting psychological degeneration.

<h3 dir="ltr">My THEORY AS TO WHY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF MEMANTINE BEFORE</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Memantine was invented in 1968 so it's no longer under patent. The antidepressant effects weren't discovered until its patent had expired.  At that point, the cost to overcoming the FDA's regulatory hurdles required for a new prescriptive usage may have exceeded the profit made by selling it to the small fraction of the population that it could help.  It cost about a billion dollars and takes about 10 years to get a drug approved for a new usage.</p>

</b></b>Amphetamine Neurotoxicity and Tolerance Prevention</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s a great explanation of  how amphetamine tolerance (or more specifically, desensitization to catecholamines) occurs and how NMDA receptor antagonists such as Memantine reverse this process from <a href="https://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1084099#post1084099">https://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1084099#post1084099</a></p>

<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;">First of all, a little on desensitization to stimulation in general. Your body naturally desensitizes itself to constant stimulation. This is the reason why you don't even feel the clothes on your body. Your clothes are constantly activating the touch receptors within your skin, and it would drive you crazy if the neurons in your skin were constantly sending the information to your brain that reminds you you're wearing clothes. This is why sometimes scarves can be uncomfortable in the beginning of the winter, because the touch receptors in your neck don't usually receive constant stimuli, so you notice it when you wear a scarf more than other kinds of clothing like pants and shirts and socks, that you wear year-round. You wear scarves much less often and are thus less desensitized to feeling them.

We also see evidence of desensitization (or lack thereof) in infants and toddlers. Kids are sometimes so hard to keep clothed because the constant stimulation to their touch receptors bothers them so much. The reason why we're able to discipline ourselves to keep clothed later in life is because we get desensitized to it over time, making it not bother us starting at a relatively early age.

Anyway, I'm going to get into what causes amphetamine tolerance now that you understand the basic idea behind desensitization and why it plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis. When we take adderall, we're essentially very radically unbalancing the normal level of chemicals of our brain. Amphetamines enter the brain, and force neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin out of the brain. It's very hard on our bodies and our brain seeks to maintain homeostasis by gradually desensitizing us to it, not really realizing that the improved focus is really helping us in our daily lives, not hurting us.

So now you have a basic understanding of what desensitization is and why it occurs. I'm going to explain how our body knows to start to desensitize itself to amphetamine, now. A calcium ion (Ca2+) influx occurs secondary to amphetamine administration, and this is what causes the body to know to desensitize to amphetamine. Your body sees its neurotransmitter levels being messed with so harshly, and it responds by telling itself to react less to diminish the problem.

I'm going to explain now a little bit on NMDA and glutamate and why it's relevant. Glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, and NMDA receptors activate by binding to glutamate and glycine. If they are not bound to glutamate and glycine, they are inactive. The NMDA receptor channel is the cite of the Ca2+ influx, so by inactivating the channel, you can essentially stop what causes tolerance and even reverse it. NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine downregulate glutamate, inactivating NMDA receptor channels, indirectly putting a limit on Ca2+ influx and consequently influencing amphetamine tolerance.

As I said, the effect of NMDA receptor antagonists on amphetamine tolerance have not been extensively studied, but NMDA receptor antagonists on another kind of tolerance have been studied very extensively - opiates. There is an absolute wealth of information and studies on NMDA receptor antagonists reducing opiate tolerance. This is because the body recognizes the calcium ion influx to indicate tolerance to both opiates and amphetamines. I imagine that this trend can only suggest that NMDA receptor antagonists can be used to treat tolerance to a number of different kinds of drugs, so long as they rely on Ca2+ influx to determine desensitization must occur, although this is purely my speculation. I think it deserves to be looked into, however.

I'm going to delve a little deeper into how electrical signals in neurons are generated in order to better explain exactly how the Ca2+ influx works. If you've ever taken a chemistry class, you probably remember that ions are compounds with a charge. They've either lost or gained electrons to become more positive or negative, respectively. Neurons maintain a difference in charge within the cell membrane and outside the cell membrane through maintaining the ionic composition within and outside the cells.

Think of a battery. Potential energy is stored in a battery by holding opposite charges apart from each other. If you have some understanding of basic physics, you know potential energy is energy that is dormant but has the potential to be used. When a nerve cell is stimulated beyond the threshold, it responds by releasing some of the negative ionic compounds within the cell membrane, causing positive ionic compounds to flood in. The change in voltage is what generates the electric signal, and it causes neighboring segments along the length of the axon to release negative ionic compounds as well, which then stimulates its neighboring segments, and so on. This is how an electric signal travels down the axon of a nerve cell, the long string-like connector to the receptor cells.

So now you understand electrical signals in neurons, in a nutshell, and you can make the connection of the role of the positive ionic compound Ca2+ in signaling something to the body.

As I've stated above, NMDA receptor antagonists downregulate glutamate in the brain, which shuts off the Ca2+ influx, telling the body to not desensitize itself to dopamine and norepinephrine and serotonin. This is the mechanism by which they stop tolerance.

I'd like to touch a little on how NMDA receptor antagonists help with Alzheimer's Disease now. Someone responded to a previous poster's assertion that the NMDA receptor antagonist's role in amphetamine tolerance is unrelated to its function for treating Alzheimer's Disease is ridiculous. I want to offer the explanation for why the person who said this was correct that the two functions are unrelated, even though they both rely on downregulation of glutamate. Alzheimer's Disease is a genetic predisposition for upregulation of glutamate in the brain with age. An influx of glutamate in the brain interferes with short term memory, and even long term memory over time. NMDA receptor antagonists slow the mental degeneration characterized by Alzheimer's Disease by downregulating glutamate, because in this case, too much glutamate is causing memory deficiencies.
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember that when treating amphetamine tolerance, you're downregulating a stable level of glutamate. What you're actually looking to downregulate is the influx of Ca2+, but NMDA receptor antagonists allow you to regulate this indirectly, through downregulation of glutamate causing NMDA receptor channels to inactivate.
