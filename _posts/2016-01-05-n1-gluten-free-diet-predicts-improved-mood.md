### Study Abstract

<p class="ng-binding">
  These data suggest with a medium degree of confidence (p=0.038) that Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil has a weakly positive predictive relationship (R=0.255) with Overall Mood. The highest quartile of Overall Mood measurements were observed following an average 0.08 servings of Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil. The lowest quartile of Overall Mood measurements were observed following an average 0.08 servings of Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil.

### Study Background

<p class="ng-binding">
  In order to reduce suffering through the advancement of human knowledge, I have chosen to share my findings regarding the relationship of Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) on Overall Mood.<img class="wp-image-19853 size-full alignright" src="https://quantimo.do/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ice_screenshot_20160105-112823-e1452051488431.png" alt="ice_screenshot_20160105-112823" width="382" height="254" />

### Study Objective

<p class="ng-binding">
  The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the relationship (if any) between the Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) and the Overall Mood. Additionally, we attempt to determine the Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) values most likely to produce optimal Overall Mood values.
</p>

### Study Design

<p class="ng-binding">
  This study design is consistent with an n=1 observational natural experiment.
</p>

### Data Analysis

<p class="ng-binding">
  Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) data below 0 serving was assumed erroneous and removed. 0 serving was assumed for days without Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) data. It was assumed that 0.5 hours would pass before a change in Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) would produce an observable change in Overall Mood. It was assumed that Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) could produce an observable change in Overall Mood for as much as 7 days after the stimulus event.
</p>

### Data Sources

<p class="ng-binding">
  The <a href="https://quantimo.do/">QuantiModo</a> platform was used to aggregate data from the <a href="https://quantimo.do/data-sources">data sources</a>.
</p> Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) data was collect using: 

[MyFitnessPal][1]. Overall Mood data was collected using: [Good Day Journal, MoodiModo, MoodiModo Ionic, MoodiModo Web, MoodPanda, Moodscope, Quantimo.do, QuantiModo, QuantiPress][1]. 
### Significance Explanation

<p class="ng-binding">
  Using a two-tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05, it was determined that the change in Overall Mood is statistically significant at 95% confidence interval.
</p>

### Study Limitations

<p class="ng-binding">
  As with any human experiment, it was impossible to control for all potentially confounding variables. The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations. Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time. 13 paired data points were used in this analysis. Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance. Furthermore, it will be very enlightening to aggregate this data with the data from other participants with similar genetic, diseasomic, environmentomic, and demographic profiles.

### Study Results

<p class="ng-binding">
  This analysis suggests that HIGHER Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) (Foods) generally predicts HIGHER Overall Mood (p = 0.038). Overall Mood is, on average, 15% HIGHER after around 0.08 Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving). After an onset delay of 168 hours, Overall Mood is, on average, -1% LOWER than its average over the 168 hours following around 0.02 Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving). 13 data points were used in this analysis. The value for Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) changed 25 times, effectively running 13 separate natural experiments. The top quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 0.08 serving of Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving). The bottom quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 0.02 serving of Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving). Forward Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.255 (p=0.038, 95% CI -0.124 to 0.634 onset delay = 0.5 hours, duration of action = 168 hours) . The Reverse Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.284 (P=0.038, 95% CI -0.095 to 0.663, onset delay = -0.5 hours, duration of action = -168 hours). When the Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) value is closer to 0.08 serving than 0.02 serving, the Overall Mood value which follows is, on average, 15% percent higher than its typical value. When the Gluten Free Pasta with Olive Oil (serving) value is closer to 0.02 serving than 0.08 serving, the Overall Mood value which follows is 0% lower than its typical value.
