### Study Abstract

<p class="ng-binding">
  These data suggest,Â with a high degree of confidence (p=0), that Remeron (Treatments) has a moderately positive predictive relationship (R=0.49) with Overall Mood (Emotions). The highest quartile of Overall Mood measurements were observed following an average 3.98 mg Remeron. The lowest quartile of Overall Mood measurements were observed following an average 3.98 mg Remeron.
</p>

### Study Background

<p class="ng-binding">
  In order to reduce suffering through the advancement of human knowledge, I have chosen to share my findings regarding the relationship of Remeron on Overall Mood.
</p>

### Study Objective<a href="https://quantimo.do/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Remeron-vs-Overall-Mood-Scatterplot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-19879"><img class="size-full wp-image-19879 alignright" src="https://quantimo.do/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Remeron-vs-Overall-Mood-Scatterplot.png" alt="Remeron vs Overall Mood Scatterplot" width="457" height="250" /></a>

<p class="ng-binding">
  The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the relationship (if any) between the Remeron and the Overall Mood. Additionally, we attempt to determine the Remeron values most likely to produce optimal Overall Mood values.
</p>

### Study Design

<p class="ng-binding">
  This study design is consistent with an n=1 observational natural experiment.
</p>

### Data Analysis

<p class="ng-binding">
  Remeron data below 0 mg was assumed erroneous and removed. 0 mg was assumed for days without Remeron data. It was assumed that 0 hours would pass before a change in Remeron would produce an observable change in Overall Mood. It was assumed that Remeron could produce an observable change in Overall Mood for as much as 7 days after the stimulus event.
</p>

### Data Sources

<p class="ng-binding">
  The <a href="https://quantimo.do/">QuantiModo</a> platform was used to aggregate data from the <a href="https://quantimo.do/data-sources">data sources</a>.
</p> Remeron data was collect using: 

[Med Helper, QuantiModo][1]. Overall Mood data was collected using: [Good Day Journal, MoodiModo, MoodiModo Ionic, MoodiModo Web, MoodPanda, Moodscope, Quantimo.do, QuantiModo, QuantiPress][1]. 
### Significance Explanation

<p class="ng-binding">
  Using a two-tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05, it was determined that the change in Overall Mood is statistically significant at 95% confidence interval.
</p>

### Study Limitations

<p class="ng-binding">
  As with any human experiment, it was impossible to control for all potentially confounding variables. The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations. Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time. 86 paired data points were used in this analysis. Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Remeron values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance. Furthermore, it will be very enlightening to aggregate this data with the data from other participants with similar genetic, diseasomic, environmentomic, and demographic profiles.
</p>

### Study Results

<p class="ng-binding">
  This analysis suggests that HIGHER Remeron (Treatments) generally predicts HIGHER Overall Mood (p = 0). Overall Mood is, on average, 34% HIGHER after around 3.98 Remeron. After an onset delay of 168 hours, Overall Mood is, on average, -4% LOWER than its average over the 168 hours following around 0 Remeron. 86 data points were used in this analysis. The value for Remeron changed 81 times, effectively running 41 separate natural experiments. The top quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 3.98 mg of Remeron. The bottom quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 0 mg of Remeron. Forward Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.49 (p=0, 95% CI 0.392 to 0.588 onset delay = 0 hours, duration of action = 168 hours) . The Reverse Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.389 (P=0, 95% CI 0.291 to 0.487, onset delay = -0 hours, duration of action = -168 hours). When the Remeron value is closer to 3.98 mg than 0 mg, the Overall Mood value which follows is, on average, 34% percent higher than its typical value. When the Remeron value is closer to 0 mg than 3.98 mg, the Overall Mood value which follows is 0% lower than its typical value.
